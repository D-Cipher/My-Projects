### My-Projects

Charles V had a saying: "I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse."

I too have a saying: "I speak Python to God, Swift to the iphone, Javascript to the web, and R to my horse."

This file contains the various personal and profession projects that I've worked on.
