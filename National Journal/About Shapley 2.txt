relaimpo: Relative Importance of Regressors
Relative importance is an old topic in regression applications: Many scientists want to quantify the relative contributions of the regressors to the model's total explanatory value. The R-package relaimpo offers six different metrics for relative importance in linear models.

In the beginning, the intention of developing relaimpo simply was to provide a reasonably fast version of the (relatively) well-known method of averaging sequential sums of squares over orderings of regressors. This method is called lmg in package relaimpo because of the first known mention in Lindeman, Merenda and Gold (1980, p.119ff); Kruskall (1987) is a more well-known source for this method, and it has been re-invented by various researchers from different fields, e.g. under the names of "Shapley value regression" or "dominance analysis" . When working on this method and its properties, also in comparison to other methods, particularly also the newly-proposed method pmvd by Feldman (2005), the package grew to include the total of six metrics. After the latest additions of a less-well-known metric from Genizi (1993) and a new one from Zuber and Strimmer (2010), there are now eight different metrics, five of which yield "natural" decompositions of the model R2 in linear regression models. Besides calculation of metrics, it is also possible to obtain bootstrap confidence intervals (exploratory in nature) for the metrics themselves, their ranks and their pairwise differences. Basic printing and plotting facilities are also provided.

Versions of relaimpo
A version of package relaimpo for non-US users is offered for download on this website. Users from the US have to use the global version because of Legalese.
