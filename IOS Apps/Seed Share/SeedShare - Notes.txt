Two more things I need to do in InstantFeed:
x1) always following self
x2) clean up so that doesnt crash when not following any one
x--Reload the feed page (maybe view did appear??)
x--pull to refresh feed page
3) Log out button
...4) Sort by date
5) remove or edit your own posted feeds
6) tap to zoom
7) tap to show comments and post comments


//Low Priority
Profile picture
only show last 10 feeds
pull up to load older feeds


// take a snapshot of the detail ViewController so we can do whatever with it (cause it's only a view), and don't have to care about breaking constraints
        let snapshotView = toViewController.view.resizableSnapshotViewFromRect(toViewController.view.frame, afterScreenUpdates: true, withCapInsets: UIEdgeInsetsZero)


if let userPicture = object.valueForKey("Image")! as! PFFile {
   userPicture.getDataInBackgroundWithBlock({
      (imageData: NSData!, error NSError!) -> Void in
         if (error == nil) {
            let image = UIImage(data:imageData)
            self.ImageArray.append(image)
         }
      })
}
