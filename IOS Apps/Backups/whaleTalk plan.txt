Milestones Following Elliot's app:

1) Lecture 28: full chat and saving chat instances have been made. Created a clone of Hello World up to this point

2) Lecture 50: When elliot builds the "contacts" tab bar, lets break off into 2 projects: (1) Hello World which we will put on pause until learning firebase; (2) Pen-pals which we will continue with following the lectures.
---Decided: use the main project to continue following elliot, and make a clone to keep as the backup for this point. 

3) About Lecture 85: After learning firebase + coredata then continue to follow with Pen-pals, and pick back up Hello World.
